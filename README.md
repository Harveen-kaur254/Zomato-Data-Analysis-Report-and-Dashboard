# Zomato-Data-Analysis-Report-and-Dashboard
In this project we have analyzed the zomato dataset with the help of python by following EDA process and make dashboard in Excel which analyzez the top countries uses zomato, high ratings and all.

## Description of the project:
Zomato data analysis is the project in which we are provided with dataset which have 9551 rows and 21 columns of different data like the ratings, cuisines, country, and all. We have analyze this data with python by follow the process of EDA(Exploratory data analysis and after that make a dashboard in Excel. We have analyzed insights like the top countries, top cities, top restaurants, cuisines and all. 
This is provided dataset [Dataset](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FHarveen-kaur254%2FZomato-Data-Analysis-Report-and-Dashboard%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fexcel%2520zomato%2520dashboard.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK)

# **Exploratory Data Analysis**, 
is a technique in data analysis used to understand, summarize, and visualize the main characteristics of a dataset before performing more advanced analyses. Itâ€™s often the first step in any data science or analytics project, as it helps reveal patterns, spot anomalies, check assumptions, and establish relationships within the data.

### Key Goals of EDA:
1. **Understanding Data Structure**: Checking the dimensions, types of variables, and overall structure.
2. **Identifying Patterns and Relationships**: Spotting trends and correlations between different variables.
3. **Detecting Outliers and Anomalies**: Finding unusual data points that could affect the analysis.
4. **Ensuring Data Quality**: Checking for missing values, inconsistencies, and errors.
5. **Summarizing Data**: Using summary statistics and visualizations to get an overview.

### Common EDA Techniques:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
- **Data Visualization**: Using plots like histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps to visualize data distribution and relationships.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Identifying and deciding how to address any missing data.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examining relationships between variables.

### Tools for EDA:
Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** are commonly used for EDA, as well as visualization tools like **Tableau** and **Power BI** for more interactive insights.

EDA is a crucial step, especially for data analysts, as it forms the foundation of understanding the dataset and determining the next steps in analysis or modeling.

## What we analyze?
1. Top 5 countries which uses zomato?
2. Find the total no. of ratings distributed by colors.
3. Countries which gives 0 ratings.
4. Which currency used maximum for zomato.
5. Find the top 10 cuisines.
6. Top 10 cuisines served by restaurants.

## Insights
1. The top 5 countries according to counts is India, United states, United kingdom, Brazil, South Africa.
2. So, our maximum rating is from 2.5 to 3.5 and the color is orange. Basically this our average rating.
3. India, Brazil, United states and united kingdom gives 0 ratings.
4. India and Uk currency is maximum.
5. India is only country which has online delivery option.
